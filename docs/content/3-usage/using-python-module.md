# Using the python module 

> For this to work, I assume you have configured your AWS cli correctly. You will need the configured profile name in order to test your script. If the default profile is used you can omit the environment variable. 

## Preparation

First you will need to have a place where to run the code. For simplicityâ€™s sake this example will use the `venv` module to create an environment. You can create a virtual environment and activate it as followed: 

```shell
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Next you will need to install the module as e dependency:

```shell
pip install landingzone-organization
```

## Build your script

Now we can start using it in your python scripts, for example create a `list_workload_environments.py` file with the following content:

```python
from landingzone_organization import AWSOrganization


organization = AWSOrganization().parse()


for workload in organization.workloads(["workloads"]):
    print(f"Workload: {workload.name}")

    for account in workload.accounts:
        print(f"\tEnvironment: {account.environment} has  {account.account_id}")
```

## Test your script

Now you can simply run:

```shell
AWS_PROFILE=<YOUR CONFIGURED PROFILE> python list_workload_environments.py
```
